## Description
This is a classic Arkanoid game developed in Java as a final project for Object-Oriented Programming course. The project demonstrates the implementation of OOP principles and design patterns.

**Key features:**
1. The game is developed using Java 17+ with JavaFX/Swing for GUI.
2. Implements core OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
3. Applies multiple design patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Strategy, Observer, and State.
4. Features multithreading for smooth gameplay and responsive UI.
5. Includes sound effects, animations, and power-up systems.
6. Supports save/load game functionality and leaderboard system.

**Game mechanics:**
- Control a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy bricks
- Collect power-ups for special abilities
- Progress through multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Score points and compete on the leaderboard

## Design Patterns Implementation

_Có dùng hay không và dùng ở đâu_

### 1. Singleton Pattern
**Used in:** `GameManager`, `AudioManager`, `ResourceLoader`

**Purpose:** Ensure only one instance exists throughout the application.

---

## Multithreading Implementation
_Có dùng hay không và dùng như thế nào_

The game uses multiple threads to ensure smooth performance:

1. **Game Loop Thread**: Updates game logic at 60 FPS
2. **Rendering Thread**: Handles graphics rendering (EDT for JavaFX Application Thread)
3. **Audio Thread Pool**: Plays sound effects asynchronously
4. **I/O Thread**: Handles save/load operations without blocking UI

## Installation

1. Clone the project from the repository.
2. Open the project in the IDE.
3. Run the project.

## Usage

### Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` or `A` | Move paddle left |
| `→` or `D` | Move paddle right |
| `SPACE` | Launch ball / Shoot laser |
| `P` or `ESC` | Pause game |
| `R` | Restart game |
| `Q` | Quit to menu |

### How to Play
1. **Start the game**: Click "New Game" from the main menu.
2. **Control the paddle**: Use arrow keys or A/D to move left and right.
3. **Launch the ball**: Press SPACE to launch the ball from the paddle.
4. **Destroy bricks**: Bounce the ball to hit and destroy bricks.
5. **Collect power-ups**: Catch falling power-ups for special abilities.
6. **Avoid losing the ball**: Keep the ball from falling below the paddle.
7. **Complete the level**: Destroy all destructible bricks to advance.

### Power-ups
| Icon | Name | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| 🟦 | Expand Paddle | Increases paddle width for 10 seconds |
| 🟥 | Shrink Paddle | Decreases paddle width for 10 seconds |
| ⚡ | Fast Ball | Increases ball speed by 30% |
| 🐌 | Slow Ball | Decreases ball speed by 30% |
| 🎯 | Multi Ball | Spawns 2 additional balls |
| 🔫 | Laser Gun | Shoot lasers to destroy bricks for 15 seconds |
| 🧲 | Magnet | Ball sticks to paddle, launch with SPACE |
| 🛡️ | Shield | Protects from losing one life |
| 🔥 | Fire Ball | Ball passes through bricks for 12 seconds |

### Scoring System
- Normal Brick: 100 points
- Strong Brick: 300 points
- Explosive Brick: 500 points + nearby bricks
- Power-up Collection: 50 points
- Combo Multiplier: x2, x3, x4... for consecutive hits
